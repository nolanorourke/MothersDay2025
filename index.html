To the one who held me first,
to the one who loves me most.
To the one who takes me as I am,
the one about which I boast.

There are no words that I can use,
to show how much I care.
I see how much you do for me,
I see how much you're there.

At times I sit and think,
how I am so blessed.
You make sure I am comfortable,
even if you're stressed

I sense it every day,
the love you have for me.
I feel it in my clothes,
I feel it in my sleep.

I hear it in your voice,
I see it on your face,
I smell it in your food,
I feel it in your embrace.

And though I may not say it
as often as I should.
I wouldn't trade you for the world,
no, I never could. 

So Happy Mothers day,
a day I feel so lucky,
because if I get to say I love you
then everyday is mothers day to me.

Happy Mother’s Day! I love you, Mom.
